###  Organic

В начале было слово и это слово было "Органик". 
o - символ бесконечности 
Из этого слова и появилось все остальное. 


Инь и янь 
Zig и TS
Zig - жесткое и быстрое (для системных задач компилируемое)
TS - гибкое и мощное (для бизнес логики скриптовое)

**Introduction**  
Framework.Organic is a revolutionary next-generation glue tool system designed for managing decentralized infrastructure based on Solenopsis. This system combines ultra-compact design with flexibility, offering powerful capabilities for management and expansion.

**Compactness and Efficiency**  
The primary distinction of Framework.Organic from other similar systems is its compactness. The executable file (exe) is no larger than one megabyte, despite the system supporting tens of thousands of functions. This is achieved through the use of an ultra-compact JS Runtime that allows the execution of miniature JS scripts.

**CLI and Core Functionality**  
The CLI system of Framework.Organic is written in ZIG and includes a compact JS Runtime (QuickJS). The core of the system contains about ten basic functions, such as file handling, networking, and HTTP requests. These functions provide the necessary infrastructure for JS scripts, allowing them to interact with external APIs.

**Flexibility and Extensibility**  
One of the key features of Framework.Organic is its minimalist command-line interface, where the "O" symbol serves as the entry point. Users can either receive instructions from AI or execute a direct command, such as launching a Kubernetes cluster. Built-in functions are dynamically loaded from the server as needed, ensuring ease of use and resource efficiency.

**Module Hierarchy and Libraries**  
Framework.Organic employs a hierarchical module structure to manage tens of thousands of functions. Each module is a compact, compressed JS file that is loaded from the server only upon the first request and is stored on the client. Common dependencies, such as dynamic TypeScript interpretation, are offloaded to separate libraries, optimizing the development process.

**Collective Development**  
The system is designed to involve a large number of developers who can create and add their own modules. After security verification and compilation through CI on the server, the modules are published and made available to all users. This ensures scalability and continuous system development.

**Goals of Framework.Organic**  
Framework.Organic is focused on infrastructure deployment, key management, and development processes. The system includes tools for creating and initializing frameworks, such as a module system for Zig. The primary goal is to provide users with a powerful and convenient tool that simplifies working with global infrastructure and accelerates interactions.
