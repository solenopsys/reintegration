## Experience of Others

Let's examine whether there have been precedents in history where businesses or states faced the necessity of rapidly creating global infrastructure.

This will help determine the feasibility of creating such infrastructure within a compressed timeframe.

We will start with examples from the business world, and then look at how the Mongol Empire expanded and what infrastructure they used.
