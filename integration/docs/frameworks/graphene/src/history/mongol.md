### Expansion of the Mongol Empire
The most successful example from history is the Mongol Empire and its mobile architecture - yurts.

Mongolian yurts had many advantages. They were quickly assembled and disassembled, easily transported by carts or pack animals, and provided comfort in various climatic conditions. Yurts were used in the conquest of Central Asia, where the rapid deployment of camps allowed them to advance hundreds of kilometers in a few weeks. Also, mobile camps provided a tactical advantage in campaigns in Persia and Europe.

Yurts, in essence, are mobile dome structures that played a key role in the rapid expansion of the Mongol Empire.
