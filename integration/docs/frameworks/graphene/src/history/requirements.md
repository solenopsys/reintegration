### Deployment in Any Environment

The core principle is "deployment in spite of, not thanks to". Just as trees push through asphalt, our buildings will be constructed where it is practically impossible: in the centers of megacities, in deserts, rivers, and even in the ocean.

The main goal is to rapidly deploy a global network of thousands of research laboratories worldwide. Our task is expansion, like an advancing army, regardless of the landscape or environmental conditions. Therefore, the architecture must be viable and adaptable to any conditions.

This approach will allow us to quickly establish our global network, regardless of geography and climate. Buildings constructed based on military engineering principles will have high mobility, strength, and scalability.
