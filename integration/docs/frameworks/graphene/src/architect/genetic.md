### Genetic Code

 

Grafene will develop as a biological system, where increasingly complex structures will be created from basic elements, based on common principles. This approach is an essential necessity, as the project will evolve from small to large, from simple to more complex, and each stage will incorporate the technologies already mastered.

**For example**, at the first stage, simple buildings will be constructed, while several technologies will be implemented: convex double-glazed windows, a load-bearing hexagonal frame, rings of concrete slab segments, modular foam concrete partitions, and interior equipment ranging from air conditioners to power systems.

At the next stage, instead of a foundation, floating platforms will be created to support these buildings, allowing them to be placed in the rivers of large cities.

At the following stage, a marine floating platform for factories will be created, based on the technologies developed in earlier stages, and the robotic equipment from the workshops will be transferred to this platform.

Finally, the Ring platforms themselves will be created, which will also be built on the basis of technologies tested in previous stages.

This approach ensures the organic development of the project, where each new level of complexity rests on a solid foundation of previous achievements. This allows the creation of increasingly large-scale and ambitious structures, based on proven technologies and principles.
