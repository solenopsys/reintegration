### Principles

- **Minimum Cost**: Since Solenopsys is a non-profit organization, we do not have billions of dollars for building construction.
- **World-Class Architecture**: The project will meet the highest aesthetic and architectural standards to enable placement in the centers of modern megacities.
- **Rapid Deployment**: We cannot build projects over years - the average construction time for our buildings is 1 week.
- **Controlled Space**: Each building in the world will have a digital twin, allowing us to control thousands of facilities.
- **Lightweight**: Minimum weight is required for transportation.
- **Scalability**: Our buildings must be easily expandable, increasing the area as needed.
- **Compact Packaging**: Each structural element must be capable of compact, flat packaging.
- **Mobility**: Rapid installation or relocation, maximum adaptability.
- **Technological Sophistication**: All structures will be produced by robots.
- **Versatility**: Operation in any conditions where 99% of other architectural solutions cannot be deployed.
- **Durability**: Operation in the harshest environmental conditions, wide temperature ranges, and high static and dynamic loads.
- **Simplicity**: Achieving the result with minimal means and a minimum number of elements.
