### Stages of Development

The ultimate goal is to create a fully decentralized innovation infrastructure that is accessible from any point in the world and surpasses Silicon Valley in all parameters.

Parameters by which it is necessary to surpass Silicon Valley:

* Capitalization of technology companies within the ecosystem.
* Annual volume of venture capital investments.
* Number and quality of innovations (patents and total value of intellectual property).

#### Development Stages:

1. **Creation of an efficient organizational structure** that is capable of rapid growth.
    * Formation of an organizational structure consisting of 1,000 members.
    * Establishment of the first 50 groups covering different areas of community development.
    * Formation of a full-fledged management structure, with each group having a leader and the system having several dozen coordinators who manage the organization's activities as a whole.
    * Implementation of the basic functionality of the platform for the community to function.
2. **Creation of a financial infrastructure** with a capital of $1 billion.
    * Attracting 100 financial organizations, mainly crypto funds and venture capital funds, with a total invested capital of $1 billion to the community.
3. **Deployment of a global physical infrastructure.**
    * Deployment of a network of 1,000 R&D centers based on Graphene technology in the large cities of the world through franchising partners.
    * Construction of 8 floating factories based on Graphene technology and their placement in major ports for container delivery to any point in the world through partners.
4. **Deployment of offshore infrastructure** in the form of 50 marine platforms near the largest cities, approximately in the same places where the data centers of cloud platforms AWS, Google, Azure are currently located.
5. **Achieving a leading position in the world of technology.**
    * Surpass Silicon Valley in terms of the number, quality, and volume of financing of technology companies.

The achievement of each of these goals is not planned to be ensured through corporate management, as is done by large companies, but through the creation of necessary conditions and technologies that will allow a large number of people and companies to join this process independently, pursuing their own interests.

This can be better illustrated by the example of how government programs to support entrepreneurship contribute to the development of small and medium-sized businesses, creating favorable conditions for their growth and development.
