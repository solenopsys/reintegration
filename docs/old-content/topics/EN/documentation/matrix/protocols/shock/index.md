### SHOCK Protocol

**SHOCK Protocol** it's a binary Streaming (S), High-throughput (H), Open (O) protocol for Computing (C) on lite Kernels (K).
Designed specifically for Solenopsys Infrastructure.
 Its primary goal is to enable realtime asynchronous communication between User Iterface, microservices,compute Kernels and Devices.


### SHOCK Protocol Components
SHOCK Protocol components are part of the Converged framework.

- **Router instance**: A microservice responsible for message routing and access control.
- **Frontend library**: A library that offers an interface for interacting with SHOCK Protocol and ensures the
  connection to the router is maintained.
- **Backend libraries**: Libraries for different programming languages that provide an interface for working with SHOCK
  Protocol on the backend.
