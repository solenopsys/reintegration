### Recruitment

The Solenopsys community is organized like a mafia to grow and spread rapidly worldwide. Each member can and should recruit new participants from their surroundings and seek contacts with target groups. Our community is not amorphous like most open-source communities but an organized army with a brain center and management.

**Where we will look for people and establish contacts:**

- Scientific circles and leading technological universities worldwide.
- Major technology companies, including military ones.
- Inventors and R&D companies.
- Open-source communities.
- Patent offices and government bodies related to intellectual property.
- Crypto communities, crypto funds, and cryptocurrency developers.
- The world's largest banks.
- Venture ecosystems in different countries (Silicon Valley, China, etc.).
- Influencers as an important target for community growth.

**Integration into language environments:**

In our ecosystem, we have the concept of provinces to facilitate interaction with local communities from different countries and language speakers.

**How we will build a recruitment database:**

- Analyzing global patent databases (Google Patents, WIPO) to identify productive companies and inventors and obtain their contacts.
- Parsing world university rankings.
- Parsing scientific journals and researcher ratings.
- Analyzing stock market data and annual reports of tech companies (Bloomberg).
- Parsing major venture platforms (TechCrunch).
- Parsing GitHub to find top contributors.

**Examples of recruitment:**

For instance, our goal is to create a group at MIT, one of the leading technological universities in the world. We will use the six degrees of separation rule to find one person inside and appoint them as the group leader. Their task is to expand the group by attracting students and professors from MIT. Each new group member should engage more people from MIT.
