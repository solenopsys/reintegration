### Organizational Structure

Solenopsys is not a social network but a global network organization structured similarly to a mafia.

#### Organizational Foundation

The organizational structure of Solenopsys is borrowed from the MS13 mafia, excluding elements related to secrecy and law-breaking. Solenopsys is not a secret organization, and its members do not break the law.

#### Reasons for Choosing the MS13 Structure

MS13 emerged in the 1980s in the USA and has grown significantly despite opposition from government authorities, becoming a transnational gang with hundreds of thousands of members.

Advantages of MS13:

- Incredible resilience due to a decentralized structure.
- Ability to grow in an aggressive environment.
- Minimal skill requirements for ordinary members.
- Simplicity of organization.
- Resources and financial flows are confined within local gangs, making the organization robust.

#### Our Limitations

- We are building the community from scratch, forming it from the ground up, unlike the top-down approach seen in Silicon Valley. We rely on our resources and the crypto community, creating a new structure of innovation.
- We cannot guarantee high qualifications of participants and will rely on available personnel.
- To achieve our goals, we need a hierarchical organization capable of concentrating substantial financial and human resources.

#### Structure of MS13

Cliques are gangs, each controlling its territory. Each clique has a leader (shot caller) who manages the gang. Leaders can become mafia bosses, coordinating several cliques for large criminal projects like drug trafficking.

#### Structure of the Solenopsys Community

- **Groups**: Associations of people with common interests, formed based on professional, territorial, or organizational criteria. Groups are created by coordinators and managed by leaders.
- **Leaders**: Appointed by coordinators, leaders are responsible for recruiting new members and their initiation. They form teams for various projects.
- **Coordinators**: Manage projects involving multiple groups through their leaders. They set strategic goals, establish contacts with external organizations, create and disband groups.
- **Participants**: Join groups, have their own ratings and track records, which help determine their authority within the community.
- **Initiation**: Acceptance check for individuals and companies when changing status (Participants, Leaders, Coordinators, Corporations).
- **Provinces**: Groups united by certain characteristics, such as language or territorial affiliation.
