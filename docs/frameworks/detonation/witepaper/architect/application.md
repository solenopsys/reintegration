### ComputSet Applications

A Detonation application is composed of multiple separate applications (micro-kernels) that, during assembly, are
packaged into Linux containers. The deployment of these cellular applications can occur in a single cluster or across a
multi-cluster decentralized environment.

Cellular applications are either built from existing open-source programs or developed from scratch. These programs are
segmented, modified for data exchange via queues, and then encapsulated into containers (micro-kernels). From these
containers, deployment configurations for cellular applications in Kubernetes clusters are created. This modular
approach allows for flexibility and scalability in deployment.
