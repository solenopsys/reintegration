### Advantages of MicroKernel Architecture
- **Easy Scalability** - Microkernels can be deployed flexibly, adapting to changing load demands.
- **Resource Limitation** - Each microkernel can be restricted in terms of resource usage.
- **Resource Usage Monitoring** - Allows tracking of computational resources expended during task processing.
- **Language Independence** - Different parts of the program can be written in various programming languages.
- **Code Reusability** - Microkernels can be reused across different applications, enhancing efficiency.
