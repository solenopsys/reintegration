### What is Detonation?

Detonation is a cutting-edge real-time data processing framework designed to rapidly accelerate the launch of tech startups and empower scientific research and development. Its primary goal is to simplify the management of computational resources, enabling developers to reuse code at scale and collaborate effortlessly. Detonation allows you to decompose complex computations into simple, reusable functions that can be easily shared and integrated within the community.

Despite its incredible compactness, Detonation can be deployed on something as small as a Raspberry Pi to control a personal 3D printer. At the same time, it scales effortlessly, capable of managing entire data centers, orchestrating clusters of thousands of servers in real time. And that’s not all—these clusters can connect into a global computational network, granting access to immense processing power at the touch of a button.

With Detonation, you'll have immediate access to thousands of pre-built functions and modules, allowing you to focus on bringing your vision to life without wasting time on repetitive tasks.
