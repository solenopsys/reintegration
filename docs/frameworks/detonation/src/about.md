### What is Detonation?

Detonation is a framework for realtime data processing in a decentralized environment. It is specifically designed for massive code reuse and collaboration among developers. Detonation allows users to break down complex computations into simple computational functions and easily share and reuse computational modules within the community. The Detonation system processes any data incredibly quickly by leveraging numerous computers and thousands of computational modules created by community members.
