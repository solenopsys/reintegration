### Compatibility

Detonation is a meta-framework, which means it relies on the higher-level Kubernetes platform. Kubernetes, in turn, has numerous implementations for various tasks. This approach provides high compatibility and flexibility in using Detonation.

#### Detonation can be deployed on:

- Any Kubernetes cluster (k3s, k8s, etc.).
- Any cloud-based Kubernetes service (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.).
- Any cloud-based HPC cluster managed by Kubernetes (k3s, k8s, etc.).
- Supports processor architectures including AMD64 and ARM64.
