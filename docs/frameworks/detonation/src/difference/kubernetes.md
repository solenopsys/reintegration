### Differences from Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a platform for container orchestration, providing tools for deploying containers in a cluster and configuring their network interactions through virtual networking. Typically, Kubernetes employs a microservices architecture, where containers interact directly by establishing connections via HTTP or TCP protocols.

Detonation, on the other hand, is a platform designed to process real-time data within Kubernetes clusters. It deploys its infrastructure consisting of multiple containers within clusters. Interaction between platform components occurs through high-performance message queues, allowing for easy load balancing and distribution across numerous nodes without the need for establishing direct connections.
