### Purpose

Detonation lets you easily control complex scientific experiments, processing real-time data from thousands of sensors—just as effortlessly as playing a game on your smartphone. It also allows you to manage swarms of drones or clusters of 3D printers with thousands of actuators as one unified system.

The future of engineering lies in the fusion of AI and high-performance computing. Detonation enables you to tackle tasks across various fields—from machine learning for PCB design to managing 3D printing processes. It helps optimize workflows through generative design and simulates physical phenomena like electromagnetism, materials, and mechanics. The system also allows you to model electronic circuits and analyze data from measurement tools like oscilloscopes and industrial sensors. All of this makes Detonation a powerful tool for solving the most complex engineering challenges.
