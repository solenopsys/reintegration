### Why are Computations Necessary?

Computers are primarily designed for data processing. Even when you use simple interfaces on a smartphone or internet services, complex computational processes happen behind the scenes.
All your information is stored and processed in large data centers. That's where the necessary computations are performed - from data analysis to ensuring security.
Without these computational capabilities, modern technologies and digital services could not function. Computations are the foundation on which the digital world we use daily operates.
