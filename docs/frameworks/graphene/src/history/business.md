### Historical examples of rapid building deployment

- McDonald's: Started actively developing in the 1950s and quickly achieved impressive results. By 1961, there were already over 500 restaurants in the US. Standardization was key to their success: the company developed a recognizable design with a red roof and golden arches, which became the brand's trademark. Today, McDonald's is present in over 100 countries, with a total of over 38,000 restaurants. Despite the impressive growth rate, the current deployment speed of new restaurants does not exceed 50 standalone buildings per year.

- 7-Eleven: Founded in 1927 and is now one of the largest convenience store chains in the world. Today, the company has over 70,000 stores in 17 countries. The key to successful expansion was the standardization of the format and service standards. Thanks to this, the company was able to ensure stable growth and increase the number of stores to 400 standalone buildings per year after 70 years of network development.

- IKEA: Founded in 1943 and began international expansion in the 1970s. Today, the company is present in over 52 countries, with a total of over 400 stores. IKEA is known for its unique approach to design and standardization, which has allowed the company to achieve impressive results and become one of the leaders in the furniture and home goods market. The deployment speed of new IKEA stores is about 10 standalone buildings per year.

Conclusions: All these companies used standardized buildings and simple architecture. The deployment speed of networks in the early stages of development did not exceed several dozen buildings per year. Our goal of 1000 means that the required deployment speed is an order of magnitude greater than any historical examples.

More efficient technological and logistical solutions are needed to achieve such a fast deployment speed. Let's look deeper into history for other examples of rapid expansion.
