So, what conclusions can be drawn from the most effective examples of expansion of both ordinary and business empires? And what strategic decisions will allow us to ensure an order of magnitude greater deployment speed than the best historical examples?

- Like in biological systems, the production infrastructure should replicate itself.
- Standardized modular and mobile architecture is necessary.
- Module design should be suitable for mass production.
- In architecture, we will use dome systems and fractal scaling principles.
- To ensure fast deployment, it is necessary to use the already existing logistical infrastructure of the world and locate factories in the largest logistical hubs (seaports).
- Deployment should take place in parallel and simultaneously through reproduction via intellectual property by independent business structures around the world.
