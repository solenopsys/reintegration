## Frame Structure

The frame structure comprises the following components:

- Rods/Bars
- Connecting Nodes
- Bolts

All frame elements utilize heat-treated steel with a modulus of elasticity of 1000 MPa (megapascals). In other words, these elements can withstand loads up to 10 tons per square centimeter.
