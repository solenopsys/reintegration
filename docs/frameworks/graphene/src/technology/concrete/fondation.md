### Reinforced Concrete Foundation

The goal of our technology is to rapidly deploy a high-precision foundation anywhere in the world. For this, we use pipe concrete, which has a precise shape in the form of rings inscribed in hexagons.

#### Structure of the Pipe Concrete Shell

The pipe concrete shell consists of a thin sheet steel cone with a slight taper angle, with flanges located at the edges of the pipe. On the outer side, the steel sheets have welded reinforcement on the surface, arranged in a helical trajectory. The reinforcement prevents the shell from shifting upward after the concrete is poured and enhances the adhesion of the concrete to the shell.

#### Transportation and Deployment of the Foundation

During transportation, the shells are nested within each other, forming a high-density package. When deploying the foundation, a sand platform is formed by removing the soil. The shells are laid out, leveled, and welded together. The form is then filled with concrete, leaving empty spaces inside in the shape of a cone. To quickly cure the foundation, it is covered with a tarp and heated with steam generators to 100 degrees Celsius. This allows the foundation to gain sufficient strength for building construction within a day.

#### Use of Internal Spaces

The internal spaces can be filled with soil or used to install tanks for storing various liquids, such as water, fuel, or components for organic synthesis.

Our technology allows for the rapid and efficient deployment of a high-precision foundation anywhere in the world, making it an ideal solution for construction in challenging conditions.
