### Goals

- To create a cost-effective architectural framework that enables the rapid deployment of a global network of R&D centers and digital factories with virtual twins of production spaces.

- To create thousands of R&D centers with controlled spaces around the world within a few years, not decades. The approximate deployment speed is 1000 standalone buildings or one million square meters per year.
