#### Building Types

- **Box:** A specially designed container system for the rapid delivery of quickly-assembled buildings to any point in the world using standard 40-foot container transportation. After delivery, the containers transform into multi-level storage complexes. Cost: $100 per square meter.
- **Tube:** Compact, quickly-assembled buildings for R&D centers that can be deployed in any location within a week, even in areas without existing infrastructure. Cost: $200 per square meter.
- **Dome:** Quickly-assembled digital factory workshops that can be delivered and deployed in any location within a month. The architecture is specifically designed for high-precision digital production. Cost: $400 per square meter.
- **Ring:** Autonomous, horizontal skyscrapers designed for offshore placement near the coastline (approximately 25 kilometers away). The innovative building architecture with a volumetric foundation allows for resistance to category 5 storms with wave heights of up to 20 meters (maximum possible wave height of 30 meters at which the building remains stable). Displacement is approximately 10,000 tons and the building area is several tens of thousands of square meters. Cost: $600 per square meter.
