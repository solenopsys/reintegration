### UHPC (Ultra-High Performance Concrete)

UHPC is an ultra-high-strength concrete that exhibits high compressive and tensile strength, allowing the creation of thin-walled structures. Another advantage of UHPC is the reduction of structural weight, which enables the construction of more efficient buildings. For example, the strength of the first floor and foundation directly depends on the total mass of the building.

#### Technologies we will use:

- **Robot assembly**. Since our standard elements will be used in thousands, we will produce them with the help of robots.
- **Cutting of carbon fiber in place** before concrete production will be done using a carbon fiber thread for precise production of carbon fiber with the use of CNC cutting. This will allow precise control of the fiber length and percentage composition of lengths, as well as guarantee the quality of the initial fiber.
- **Ultrasonic mixing** of carbon fibers with a plasticizer. The peculiarity of carbon fiber is that it has a high surface tension coefficient, which makes fiber mixing difficult. Carbon fibers also have ten times more fibers per thread compared to glass fibers.
- **Ultrasonic compaction** of the concrete mixture.
- **Vacuum treatment** of concrete for rapid degassing and increased strength.
- **Rapid hardening** of concrete using autoclave heating significantly enhances its strength and  accelerating the process when using mass production.

#### Applications of UHPC:

**For creating floor slabs** - A new technology will be used based on thin-walled carbon fiber-reinforced UHPC, reinforcement, and a reinforcing mesh for concrete. The wall thickness of the slabs will be around 20 mm.

**For furniture creation** - Concrete tabletops, chairs, etc.

**Surface of aerated concrete panels** - Wall modules will be made of aerated concrete, with the surface layers consisting of UHPC.
