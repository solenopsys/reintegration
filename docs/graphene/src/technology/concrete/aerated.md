### Aerated Concrete

Aerated concrete has a low density and thermal conductivity, which can be useful for creating wall modules and insulated floor slabs.  

Aerated concrete is a type of lightweight concrete that has a low density and thermal conductivity, making it a suitable material for creating wall modules and insulated floor slabs.

Main features and advantages of aerated concrete:

1. **Low Density**: Aerated concrete has a density ranging from 300 to 800 kg/m³, which is much lower than regular concrete. This reduces the load on the foundation and allows for a lighter building structure.

2. **Low Thermal Conductivity**: Due to the presence of small closed pores, aerated concrete has good thermal insulation properties. The thermal conductivity coefficient ranges from 0.07 to 0.18 W/(m·K), ensuring high energy efficiency and reducing heating and cooling costs.

3. **Sound Insulation**: The porous structure of aerated concrete also contributes to good sound insulation, making it an attractive material for interior and exterior walls.

4. **Fire Resistance**: Aerated concrete has high fire resistance and can withstand temperatures up to 1000°C without losing its load-bearing capacity.

5. **Durability**: With proper care and protection from atmospheric influences, aerated concrete can last for more than 100 years.

6. **Eco-Friendliness**: Aerated concrete is an environmentally friendly material that does not contain toxic substances and is easily recyclable.

Thanks to its unique properties, aerated concrete is widely used in the construction of energy-efficient buildings, as well as for insulating walls and floor slabs. Its lightness and strength make it an attractive choice for prefabricated construction.
