### Technology

Technology is the key word in this project, and the main principle is the use of technology to achieve goals. Without advanced solutions, it is impossible to solve the tasks at hand. High-quality technologies allow for much better results to be achieved using the same resources. The shape of a material often determines its efficiency.

The technologies we will use include:

* **High-strength materials:** UHPC, heat-treated steel, reinforced fibers
* **High-performance structures:** special-shaped trusses, circular structures, cable usage
* **Robotics application**
* **Laser technology usage**
* **Digital manufacturing and computer optimization**

These advanced technologies will enable the creation of strong, lightweight, and efficient structures for the project's implementation.
