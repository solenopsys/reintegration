### Inspired

This concept is inspired by the works and approaches of renowned architects. At its core are the innovative ideas of Buckminster Fuller - the use of thin shells capable of working in both compression and tension. 

Fuller's influence is seen in the solutions realized by Norman Foster, such as the load-bearing shells of the "Gherkin" building and the suspension of the HSBC Main Building. The concept of Le Corbusier's "House as a Machine for Living" and ribbon glazing is also reflected in this project. 

This is a bold and innovative approach that combines cutting-edge engineering and expressive aesthetics. The architectural style of the project follows its function - it is High-Tech.

**Key Principles We Will Employ:**

- Thin, load-bearing shells
- Structures working in both compression and tension
- Single elements performing multiple functions
- The building as a "machine for living"
