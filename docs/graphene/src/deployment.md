### Deployment

#### Goal
Our task is to create thousands of R&D centers with controlled spaces around the world within a few years, not decades. The approximate deployment speed is 1000 standalone buildings or one million square meters per year.

### Historical examples of rapid building deployment

- McDonald's: Started actively developing in the 1950s and quickly achieved impressive results. By 1961, there were already over 500 restaurants in the US. Standardization was key to their success: the company developed a recognizable design with a red roof and golden arches, which became the brand's trademark. Today, McDonald's is present in over 100 countries, with a total of over 38,000 restaurants. Despite the impressive growth rate, the current deployment speed of new restaurants does not exceed 50 standalone buildings per year.

- 7-Eleven: Founded in 1927 and is now one of the largest convenience store chains in the world. Today, the company has over 70,000 stores in 17 countries. The key to successful expansion was the standardization of the format and service standards. Thanks to this, the company was able to ensure stable growth and increase the number of stores to 400 standalone buildings per year after 70 years of network development.

- IKEA: Founded in 1943 and began international expansion in the 1970s. Today, the company is present in over 52 countries, with a total of over 400 stores. IKEA is known for its unique approach to design and standardization, which has allowed the company to achieve impressive results and become one of the leaders in the furniture and home goods market. The deployment speed of new IKEA stores is about 10 standalone buildings per year.

Conclusions: All these companies used standardized buildings and simple architecture. The deployment speed of networks in the early stages of development did not exceed several dozen buildings per year. Our goal of 1000 means that the required deployment speed is an order of magnitude greater than any historical examples.

More efficient technological and logistical solutions are needed to achieve such a fast deployment speed. Let's look deeper into history for other examples of rapid expansion.

### Expansion of the Mongol Empire
The most successful example from history is the Mongol Empire and its mobile architecture - yurts.

Mongolian yurts had many advantages. They were quickly assembled and disassembled, easily transported by carts or pack animals, and provided comfort in various climatic conditions. Yurts were used in the conquest of Central Asia, where the rapid deployment of camps allowed them to advance hundreds of kilometers in a few weeks. Also, mobile camps provided a tactical advantage in campaigns in Persia and Europe.

Yurts, in essence, are mobile dome structures that played a key role in the rapid expansion of the Mongol Empire.

So, what conclusions can be drawn from the most effective examples of expansion of both ordinary and business empires? And what strategic decisions will allow us to ensure an order of magnitude greater deployment speed than the best historical examples?

- Like in biological systems, the production infrastructure should replicate itself.
- Standardized modular and mobile architecture is necessary.
- Module design should be suitable for mass production.
- In architecture, we will use dome systems and fractal scaling principles.
- To ensure fast deployment, it is necessary to use the already existing logistical infrastructure of the world and locate factories in the largest logistical hubs (seaports).
- Deployment should take place in parallel and simultaneously through reproduction via intellectual property by independent business structures around the world.
