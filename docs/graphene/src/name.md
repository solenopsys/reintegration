### Name

The project's name "Graphene" is derived from carbon nanotubes. This project is inspired and built in the image and likeness of these unique nanostructures.

The surface of the shells consists of a steel frame in the shape of hexagons and has a two-layer structure, similar to nanotubes. The load-bearing structure of the offshore platforms is also based on the repetition of this tubular architecture.

Thus, the key elements of the "Graphene" project draw inspiration and engineering solutions directly from the nature of carbon nanotubes - some of the strongest and lightest materials known to humanity.
