## Box elements
The system consists of three main elements:
- Wall - the main load-bearing element of the structure
- Beam - beams connect the walls to each other and provide rigidity to the structure
- Slab - concrete slab forming horizontal surfaces (floors and ceilings)

### Wall
It is made of five elements:
- Corners  casting steel
- Round perimeter pipes  
- Wave-shaped wall made of coiled steel
- Stainless steel welded nuts
- High-strength concrete filling the perimeter and corners

#### Wall Manufacturing Process
1. The round perimeter pipes are cut on a laser machine.
2. Stainless steel nuts are welded into the pipes.
3. Corners are made by casting steel
4. The wave walls are made from coiled steel by rolling through rollers and laser cutting.
5. The perimeter is welded from round pipes and corners, with the wave walls welded to the perimeter using laser welding.
6. The perimeter is filled with concrete.
7. A layer of epoxy paint is applied.


### Beam
It is made of thick sheet steel and high-strength concrete. The steel is cut by laser, then welded by laser, after which it is placed in a mold which is filled with concrete.

### Slab 
At the base it has a perforated 3D steel sheet, reinforced with rebar at the corners. Around the steel sheet, a concrete shell is formed from high-strength concrete.
