## Simple Storage System (SSS)

The SSS is a simple system for packaging Graphene floors in the form factor of standard 40-foot marine containers. The goal of the SSS is to ensure delivery of Graphene floors to any point in the world via standard transportation means and, after delivery, provide the ability to create inexpensive technical buildings for housing and storing equipment.

#### Advantages
- The form factor and strength of the containers allow them to be transported on ships as standard containers.
- Compact size when stored disassembled: the container takes up 20% of the volume of the unassembled container.
- Possibility of reuse after delivery, based on the elements, multi-level warehouse complexes can be assembled.
- Scalability: the device can operate as a single container or as a warehouse complex containing hundreds of containers.

#### Requirements
- 40 High Cube 12.192 x 2.896 x 2.438 m
- Maximum gross weight 35 tons
- Net weight 30 tons  
- Tare weight of container 5 tons
- Passing CSC certification

### Wall Construction
The system consists of three main elements:
- Wall - the main load-bearing element of the structure
- Beam - beams connect the walls to each other and provide rigidity to the structure
- Slab - concrete slab forming horizontal surfaces (floors and ceilings)

### Beam
It is made of thick sheet steel and high-strength concrete. The steel is cut by laser, then welded by laser, after which it is placed in a mold which is filled with concrete.

### Slab 
At the base it has a perforated 3D steel sheet, reinforced with rebar at the corners. Around the steel sheet, a concrete shell is formed from high-strength concrete.

### Wall
It is made of five elements:
- Corners  casting steel
- Round perimeter pipes  
- Wave-shaped wall made of coiled steel
- Stainless steel welded nuts
- High-strength concrete filling the perimeter and corners

#### Wall Manufacturing Process
1. The round perimeter pipes are cut on a laser machine.
2. Stainless steel nuts are welded into the pipes.
3. Corners are made by casting steel
4. The wave walls are made from coiled steel by rolling through rollers and laser cutting.
5. The perimeter is welded from round pipes and corners, with the wave walls welded to the perimeter using laser welding.
6. The perimeter is filled with concrete.
7. A layer of epoxy paint is applied.
