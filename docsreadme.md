### Name

The project's name "Graphene" is derived from carbon nanotubes. This project is inspired and built in the image and likeness of these unique nanostructures.

The surface of the shells consists of a steel frame in the shape of hexagons and has a two-layer structure, similar to nanotubes. The load-bearing structure of the offshore platforms is also based on the repetition of this tubular architecture.

Thus, the key elements of the "Graphene" project draw inspiration and engineering solutions directly from the nature of carbon nanotubes - some of the strongest and lightest materials known to humanity.

### Inspired

This concept is inspired by the works and approaches of renowned architects. At its core are the innovative ideas of Buckminster Fuller - the use of thin shells capable of working in both compression and tension. 

Fuller's influence is seen in the solutions realized by Norman Foster, such as the load-bearing shells of the "Gherkin" building and the suspension of the HSBC Main Building. The concept of Le Corbusier's "House as a Machine for Living" and ribbon glazing is also reflected in this project. 

This is a bold and innovative approach that combines cutting-edge engineering and expressive aesthetics. The architectural style of the project follows its function - it is High-Tech.

**Key Principles We Will Employ:**

- Thin, load-bearing shells
- Structures working in both compression and tension
- Single elements performing multiple functions
- The building as a "machine for living"

### Genetic Code

**Common Genetic Code and General Principles**

Grafene will develop as a biological system, where increasingly complex structures will be created from basic elements, based on common principles. This approach is an essential necessity, as the project will evolve from small to large, from simple to more complex, and each stage will incorporate the technologies already mastered.

**For example**, at the first stage, simple buildings will be constructed, while several technologies will be implemented: convex double-glazed windows, a load-bearing hexagonal frame, rings of concrete slab segments, modular foam concrete partitions, and interior equipment ranging from air conditioners to power systems.

At the next stage, instead of a foundation, floating platforms will be created to support these buildings, allowing them to be placed in the rivers of large cities.

At the following stage, a marine floating platform for factories will be created, based on the technologies developed in earlier stages, and the robotic equipment from the workshops will be transferred to this platform.

Finally, the Ring platforms themselves will be created, which will also be built on the basis of technologies tested in previous stages.

This approach ensures the organic development of the project, where each new level of complexity rests on a solid foundation of previous achievements. This allows the creation of increasingly large-scale and ambitious structures, based on proven technologies and principles.

### Principles

- **Minimum Cost**: Since Solenopsys is a non-profit organization, we do not have billions of dollars for building construction.
- **World-Class Architecture**: The project will meet the highest aesthetic and architectural standards to enable placement in the centers of modern megacities.
- **Rapid Deployment**: We cannot build projects over years - the average construction time for our buildings is 1 week.
- **Controlled Space**: Each building in the world will have a digital twin, allowing us to control thousands of facilities.
- **Lightweight**: Minimum weight is required for transportation.
- **Scalability**: Our buildings must be easily expandable, increasing the area as needed.
- **Compact Packaging**: Each structural element must be capable of compact, flat packaging.
- **Mobility**: Rapid installation or relocation, maximum adaptability.
- **Technological Sophistication**: All structures will be produced by robots.
- **Versatility**: Operation in any conditions where 99% of other architectural solutions cannot be deployed.
- **Durability**: Operation in the harshest environmental conditions, wide temperature ranges, and high static and dynamic loads.
- **Simplicity**: Achieving the result with minimal means and a minimum number of elements.

### Nodes
The nodes consist of a steel ring with 6 holes for attaching the rods. Every other hole is designed to accommodate a wrench or socket for tightening the bolts.

### Rods
The rods are circular bars with a threaded hole drilled at each end to allow attachment and fastening using the bolts and nodes.

### Bolts
Hexagonal socket bolts are used.

## Frame Structure

The frame structure comprises the following components:

- Rods/Bars
- Connecting Nodes
- Bolts

All frame elements utilize heat-treated steel with a modulus of elasticity of 1000 MPa (megapascals). In other words, these elements can withstand loads up to 10 tons per square centimeter.



### UHPC (Ultra-High Performance Concrete)

UHPC is an ultra-high-strength concrete that exhibits high compressive and tensile strength, allowing the creation of thin-walled structures. Another advantage of UHPC is the reduction of structural weight, which enables the construction of more efficient buildings. For example, the strength of the first floor and foundation directly depends on the total mass of the building.

#### Technologies we will use:

- **Robot assembly**. Since our standard elements will be used in thousands, we will produce them with the help of robots.
- **Cutting of carbon fiber in place** before concrete production will be done using a carbon fiber thread for precise production of carbon fiber with the use of CNC cutting. This will allow precise control of the fiber length and percentage composition of lengths, as well as guarantee the quality of the initial fiber.
- **Ultrasonic mixing** of carbon fibers with a plasticizer. The peculiarity of carbon fiber is that it has a high surface tension coefficient, which makes fiber mixing difficult. Carbon fibers also have ten times more fibers per thread compared to glass fibers.
- **Ultrasonic compaction** of the concrete mixture.
- **Vacuum treatment** of concrete for rapid degassing and increased strength.
- **Rapid hardening** of concrete using autoclave heating significantly enhances its strength and  accelerating the process when using mass production.

#### Applications of UHPC:

**For creating floor slabs** - A new technology will be used based on thin-walled carbon fiber-reinforced UHPC, reinforcement, and a reinforcing mesh for concrete. The wall thickness of the slabs will be around 20 mm.

**For furniture creation** - Concrete tabletops, chairs, etc.

**Surface of aerated concrete panels** - Wall modules will be made of aerated concrete, with the surface layers consisting of UHPC.



### Aerated Concrete

Aerated concrete has a low density and thermal conductivity, which can be useful for creating wall modules and insulated floor slabs.  

Aerated concrete is a type of lightweight concrete that has a low density and thermal conductivity, making it a suitable material for creating wall modules and insulated floor slabs.

Main features and advantages of aerated concrete:

1. **Low Density**: Aerated concrete has a density ranging from 300 to 800 kg/m³, which is much lower than regular concrete. This reduces the load on the foundation and allows for a lighter building structure.

2. **Low Thermal Conductivity**: Due to the presence of small closed pores, aerated concrete has good thermal insulation properties. The thermal conductivity coefficient ranges from 0.07 to 0.18 W/(m·K), ensuring high energy efficiency and reducing heating and cooling costs.

3. **Sound Insulation**: The porous structure of aerated concrete also contributes to good sound insulation, making it an attractive material for interior and exterior walls.

4. **Fire Resistance**: Aerated concrete has high fire resistance and can withstand temperatures up to 1000°C without losing its load-bearing capacity.

5. **Durability**: With proper care and protection from atmospheric influences, aerated concrete can last for more than 100 years.

6. **Eco-Friendliness**: Aerated concrete is an environmentally friendly material that does not contain toxic substances and is easily recyclable.

Thanks to its unique properties, aerated concrete is widely used in the construction of energy-efficient buildings, as well as for insulating walls and floor slabs. Its lightness and strength make it an attractive choice for prefabricated construction.

## Concrete
In all structures, concrete will be actively used, with UHPC (ultra-high performance concrete), aerated concrete, and various compositions of these materials being utilized.

### Glass
Standard 4mm thick glass is used.

## IGU - Insulated Glazing Unit



### Closed Cylinders
These cylinders have a closed end and are used as container lids. They can nest inside each other for compact storage and transportation. The closed cylindrical design allows for efficient stacking and space-saving when not in use as lids.

### Open Cylinder

We use non-equal-sided cylinders to enable dense packing. During storage or transportation, the cylinders can be nested inside each other, taking up minimal space in the container or warehouse. This approach helps to optimize space utilization and reduce storage and transportation costs.

## Cylinders

- Closed
- Open

### Technology

Technology is the key word in this project, and the main principle is the use of technology to achieve goals. Without advanced solutions, it is impossible to solve the tasks at hand. High-quality technologies allow for much better results to be achieved using the same resources. The shape of a material often determines its efficiency.

The technologies we will use include:

* **High-strength materials:** UHPC, heat-treated steel, reinforced fibers
* **High-performance structures:** special-shaped trusses, circular structures, cable usage
* **Robotics application**
* **Laser technology usage**
* **Digital manufacturing and computer optimization**

These advanced technologies will enable the creation of strong, lightweight, and efficient structures for the project's implementation.

### Deployment in Any Environment

The core principle is "deployment in spite of, not thanks to". Just as trees push through asphalt, our buildings will be constructed where it is practically impossible: in the centers of megacities, in deserts, rivers, and even in the ocean.

The main goal is to rapidly deploy a global network of thousands of research laboratories worldwide. Our task is expansion, like an advancing army, regardless of the landscape or environmental conditions. Therefore, the architecture must be viable and adaptable to any conditions.

This approach will allow us to quickly establish our global network, regardless of geography and climate. Buildings constructed based on military engineering principles will have high mobility, strength, and scalability.

## Deep and Shallow Sea

## Deep and Shallow Sea

The ocean holds vast expanses of space, and positioning vessels there comes at no cost. For instance, land in New York may cost $25,000 per square meter, but just 300 meters offshore, you can station vessels of any size, even those as large as skyscrapers, for free.

Why is it so challenging to create a floating city or island in the sea, despite numerous conceptual designs? The primary issue lies in the fact that a floating island, even one of considerable size, will sway with the waves if it's not anchored to the seabed.

Why does this occur? The problem stems from the nature of ocean waves, which are formed by wind, the moon's gravity, earthquakes, and other factors. Most of the time, waves have relatively short lengths and amplitudes, such as 50 meters long and a few meters high. However, there are relatively brief periods, a couple of days a year, when hurricanes can form in the ocean. These hurricanes can affect the ocean surface for tens of hours, reach wind speeds of up to 100 km/h, and have wind influence ranges of several thousand miles. Under these conditions, long waves of 200-400 meters in length and amplitudes reaching 20 meters can form.

### Wave Force

![waves.svg](./content/images/waves.svg)

In such sea conditions, even a floating island made of reinforced concrete, with a diameter of 1 kilometer and a mass of one million tons, would start oscillating at its own frequency, and these oscillations could reach several meters. In such circumstances, anyone would feel seasick. This is the main reason why floating islands are not built in the ocean.


### Methods of Counteracting Wave Motion

* Increase the object's size beyond the wavelength and make it round.
* Secure the object to the seafloor.
* Design the hull to be streamlined.
* Install stabilization systems.

How Large Marine Platforms Handle Waves:

These platforms are engineered to withstand extreme ocean conditions, including massive waves. Their construction relies on robust materials like steel and concrete, and they are designed to have a large mass with a low center of gravity for stability.

The foundation of these platforms plays a crucial role: deep-sea platforms are often anchored to the ocean floor using piles, while floating platforms employ complex anchor and mooring line systems.

The shape of the platforms also matters - many are designed to allow waves to pass through or around the structure, reducing the force of their impact.

Modern oil rigs are equipped with active stabilization systems, including computerized ballast systems that continuously regulate the platform's position.

These are excellent examples of wave resilience that we can learn from. However, even with these sophisticated measures, during storms, these platforms still sway, making it uncomfortable to be inside.



#### Can we solve this problem through technological means?

To address this, we need to examine the structure of ocean waves and the principles by which a wave's kinetic energy is transferred to a structure in more detail.


### Еnergy Transfer in Waves
Waves transfer energy as they move and break near the shore. As waves approach shallower water, their speed decreases, causing their height to increase until they break, releasing energy.

### Wave Energy Near the Shore
When waves break, they transfer energy to the shore, contributing to coastal erosion and sediment transport. The energy of breaking waves depends on factors like wave height, wave period, and water depth.


The terms "deep" and "shallow" refer to the relationship between water depth and wavelength, and the use of these terms allows scientists to describe the characteristics of wave propagation in various marine conditions. For example, in the theory of deep-water waves (in deep sea), equations can be simplified by ignoring the influence of the bottom. In shallow seas, on the other hand, the influence of the bottom and changes in depth become important.


### Deep Water Wave Theory

### Deep Sea:
A sea is considered deep if its depth is significantly greater than the wavelength. In deep sea, waves usually exhibit properties characteristic of deep-water waves. These waves do not feel the bottom, and their speed depends only on their length.



#### Behavior and Properties
In deep water, waves travel faster and are less affected by the seabed. Waves are considered deep water waves if the water depth is greater than half the wavelength. The speed of these waves is given by:
\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi}} \]
where \( v \) is the wave speed, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. This allows the waves to maintain their properties and energy over long distances.

#### Energy and Particle Motion
The energy of deep water waves is split between kinetic and potential energy. Water particles move in circular orbits, preserving wave shape and energy as they travel. This orbital motion diminishes with depth, minimizing seabed effects.

### Shallow Water Wave Theory

### Shallow Sea:
Conversely, a sea is considered shallow if its depth is comparable to the wavelength. In shallow sea, waves interact with the bottom, and their properties depend not only on the wavelength but also on the water depth. In this case, the formation of various types of waves, such as coastal waves, is possible.

#### Behavior and Properties
As waves approach the shore and enter shallow water, their behavior changes. In shallow water (depth less than one-twentieth of the wavelength), waves slow down, their wavelength shortens, and their height increases, leading to wave breaking. The wave speed in shallow water is:
\[ v = \sqrt{gd} \]
where \( v \) is the wave speed, \( g \) is gravity, and \( d \) is the water depth.

### Dependence of Wave Amplitude on Depth

The amplitude of a wave decreases with depth due to the diminishing effect of wave energy transfer. In deep water, wave-induced particle motion follows circular orbits, and the amplitude exponentially decreases with depth. The reduction in amplitude can be described by:
\[ A(z) = A_0 e^{-kz} \]
where \( A(z) \) is the amplitude at depth \( z \), \( A_0 \) is the surface amplitude, and \( k \) is the wave number. This illustrates that wave effects are most pronounced near the surface and decrease significantly with depth.



#### Breaking and Energy
When waves transition to shallow water, their kinetic energy converts to potential energy, increasing wave height. Upon breaking, significant energy is released, causing coastal erosion and sediment transport. Breaking waves form a foamy front, enhancing their impact on the shore.

#### Friction and Seabed Influence
In shallow water, friction with the seabed slows and deforms waves. Particle motion becomes elliptical, transferring energy from depth to the surface, leading to increased wave energy until breaking.

For more details, visit the original [theoretical foundations](https://ship.ee/wave_energy/theoretical-foundations/).


### Impact of Depth on Wave Energy
In deeper water, waves travel faster and with more energy. As waves move into shallower water, their energy is compressed, increasing wave height until they break.








### Comparison of weights

#### Weight of skyscrapers

The weight of a modern skyscraper can vary significantly depending on its size, structure, materials used in construction, and other factors.

For example, the weight of the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa in Dubai, is estimated to be approximately 500,000 tons. However, this weight includes not only the weight of the building itself, but also the weight of the foundation, underground floors, and other components.

On average, the weight of a modern skyscraper can range from 100,000 to 300,000 tons, but these figures can vary significantly depending on the specific building and its characteristics. The average weight is 200,000 tons.

#### Weight characteristics of Graphene structures

Empty 20-story building - 2,000 tons (this is 1% of the weight of an average skyscraper)
Empty ring with a perimeter of 1 kilometer - 10,000 tons (this is 5% of the weight of an average skyscraper)



Here is the English translation:

## Simple Storage System (SSS)
